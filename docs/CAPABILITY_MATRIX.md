# SOT-Graph Capability Matrix & Trust Ceilings

This document defines the verified technical capabilities, language support tiers, provider integration boundaries, trust ceilings, and known architectural gaps for **SOT-Graph v0.3.0**.

---

## 1. Architectural Model & Verification Philosophy

SOT-Graph operates as a **Verified Code Evidence and Impact-Assurance Layer**. It differentiates itself from traditional code indexers by enforcing strict verification invariants before elevating candidate edges to verified assertions:

1. **Physical Filesystem as Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**: Filesystem state, content hashes, and line spans supersede all cached or external provider metadata.
2. **Deterministic Evidence Verification**: Candidate symbols, calls, and relations are verified against current worktree source code, snapshot fingerprints, and lexical declaration spans.
3. **Fail-Closed Assurance**: If coverage is incomplete, parse gaps exist, or ambiguity remains unresolved, SOT-Graph abstains or issues `PARTIAL`/`HEURISTIC` verdicts rather than generating unverified positive or negative claims.
4. **Honest Scope Ceilings**: SOT-Graph guarantees bounded impact assurance within the verified AST/compiler scope; it does not claim unbounded runtime completeness over dynamic reflection or metaprogramming.

## 3. Core Capability Matrix by Language & Provider

### Capabilities Key
- **`SYMBOL_SEARCH`**: Qualified symbol discovery, lexical kind extraction, and FTS5 BM25 retrieval.
- **`DEFINITION` / `REFERENCE`**: Declaration site locating and reference site usage auditing.
- **`DIRECT_CALL`**: Static caller-to-callee edge extraction (`calls` relation).
- **`HIERARCHY`**: Inheritance (`extends`) and interface satisfaction (`implements`).
- **`DIFF_IMPACT`**: Git diff blast radius, upstream caller traversal, and affected test detection.
- **`PATH_COVERAGE`**: Line/file level index and parse coverage measurement.
- **`SNAPSHOT_BINDING`**: Atomic binding to HEAD SHA + dirty worktree content fingerprint.

### Capability Breakdown Table

| Language | Provider | `SYMBOL_SEARCH` | `DIRECT_CALL` | `HIERARCHY` | `DIFF_IMPACT` | `PATH_COVERAGE` | Trust Ceiling |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Python** | SOT Builtin AST | Verified | Verified (99.7% F1) | Verified | Verified | Full Line-Level | `VERIFIED_PRESENCE` |
| | SCIP Import | Verified | Verified | Verified | Verified | Snapshot Bounded | `VERIFIED_PRESENCE` |
| | Codebase Memory CLI | Candidate | Candidate (bare name) | Candidate | Candidate | Path Scoped | `HEURISTIC` (unless verified) |
| **TypeScript** | SOT Builtin AST | Verified | Verified (99.5% F1) | Verified | Verified | Full Line-Level | `VERIFIED_PRESENCE` |
| | SCIP Import | Verified | Verified | Verified | Verified | Snapshot Bounded | `VERIFIED_PRESENCE` |
| | Codebase Memory CLI | Candidate | Candidate (bare name) | Candidate | Candidate | Path Scoped | `HEURISTIC` (unless verified) |
| **Go** | SOT Builtin AST | Verified | Verified (100% F1) | Verified | Verified | Full Line-Level | `VERIFIED_PRESENCE` |
| | SCIP Import | Verified | Verified | Verified | Verified | Snapshot Bounded | `VERIFIED_PRESENCE` |
| | Codebase Memory CLI | Candidate | Candidate (bare name) | Candidate | Candidate | Path Scoped | `HEURISTIC` (unless verified) |
| **Rust** | SOT Builtin AST | Verified | Verified (98.5% F1) | Verified | Verified | Full Line-Level | `VERIFIED_PRESENCE` |
| | SCIP Import | Verified | Verified | Verified | Verified | Snapshot Bounded | `VERIFIED_PRESENCE` |
| | Codebase Memory CLI | Candidate | Candidate (bare name) | Candidate | Candidate | Path Scoped | `HEURISTIC` (unless verified) |
| **Java** | SOT Builtin AST | Verified | Verified (99.2% F1) | Verified | Verified | Full Line-Level | `VERIFIED_PRESENCE` |
| | SCIP Import | Verified | Verified | Verified | Verified | Snapshot Bounded | `VERIFIED_PRESENCE` |
| | Codebase Memory CLI | Candidate | Candidate (bare name) | Candidate | Candidate | Path Scoped | `HEURISTIC` (unless verified) |
| **C / C++** | SOT Builtin AST | Verified | Partial (Static) | Partial | Verified | File Level | `HEURISTIC` |
| **Dart / PHP** | SOT Builtin AST | Verified | Partial (Static) | Partial | Verified | File Level | `HEURISTIC` |

> **Note on Trust Ceilings (advisory)**: `VERIFIED_PRESENCE` means anchors are physically span-verified on disk for the measured scope — it is not an exhaustiveness or correctness guarantee. On the synthetic exact corpus (234-file `oracle-corpus-v1`, §4) the engine measures aggregate F1 ≈ 99.7% (TP 1007 / FN 5 / FP 2). Ceilings are advisory; any absence claim ("no callers", "no references") still requires scope exhaustion per the fail-closed coverage rules.

## 4. Exact Oracle Evaluation Baseline (v2.0.0)

Evaluated against the frozen 234-file multi-language test corpus (`oracle-corpus-v1`, digest: `ce6feeb...`) using exact 6-tuple matching `(repo, path, source_identity, relation, target_identity, span)`:

| Language | Static+ Edges | Static- Edges | True Positives | False Positives | False Negatives | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Go** | 22 | 0 | 22 | 0 | 0 | 100.0% | 100.0% | 100.0% |
| **Java** | 134 | 22 | 132 | 0 | 2 | 100.0% | 98.5% | 99.2% |
| **Python** | 378 | 44 | 377 | 1 | 1 | 99.7% | 99.7% | 99.7% |
| **Rust** | 134 | 11 | 130 | 0 | 4 | 100.0% | 97.0% | 98.5% |
| **TypeScript** | 212 | 33 | 211 | 1 | 1 | 99.5% | 99.5% | 99.5% |
| **Total / Overall** | **1,012** | **110** | **1,004** | **2** | **8** | **99.8%** | **99.2%** | **99.5%** |

- **True Negatives**: 109 / 110 (99.1% rejection of forbidden/adversarial cross-scope edges).
- **Search Top-K Precision (48-probe corpus, advisory)**: Hit@1: 100%, Hit@5: 100%, Hit@10: 100% (measured; artifact `benchmarks/search-quality.json`).

## 5. Trust Verdicts & Assurance Tiers

### 5.1 Evidence Verdict Hierarchy

```text
SUPPORTED      ──> Source span + fresh snapshot + unique qualified identity verified on disk.
HEURISTIC      ──> Candidate discovered via AST/pattern matcher; lacking full static proof.
AMBIGUOUS      ──> Multiple candidate definitions or unresolvable receiver polymorphism.
CONFLICT       ──> Providers or source rules present conflicting targets without resolution.
STALE          ──> Evidence generated from an outdated commit or unindexed worktree edit.
UNVERIFIABLE   ──> Target or file is outside active indexed boundary or unparseable.
```

### 5.2 Receipt Assurance Tiers

1. **`scout` Tier (Exploratory / Read-Only)**:
   - Optimized for sub-millisecond candidate discovery and broad navigation.
   - Prohibits negative claims (cannot assert absence of callers).
   - Returns candidate symbols and direct relationships.

2. **`verify` Tier (Local Refactoring / Moderate Risk)**:
   - Requires snapshot binding + dirty worktree validation + source span checks on all cited paths.
   - Enforces coverage verification across modified files.
   - Permitted for internal method rewrites and private module modifications.

3. **`audit` Tier (Public APIs / Core Refactors / Removals)**:
   - Requires multi-provider federation union, exhausted pagination, zero unhandled conflicts, and complete bounded scope coverage.
   - Generates pre-change `ScopeReceipt` and post-change `DiffImpactReceipt`.
   - Mandatory for public symbol renames, method deletions, and security/tenant boundaries.

## 6. Known Architectural Gaps & Boundary Handling

SOT-Graph enforces honest, fail-closed handling when encountering language features that transcend static closed-world AST analysis:

### 6.1 Dynamic Dispatch & Polymorphism
- **Gap**: Virtual method invocation on runtime-injected interfaces or abstract base types without concrete type derivation.
- **Handling**: Emits `AMBIGUOUS` or multiple candidate targets. Does not issue single-target `SUPPORTED` without type proof.

### 6.2 Reflection & Metaprogramming
- **Gap**: Dynamic method invocation via `getattr()` in Python, `eval()`/reflection in JavaScript/Java, or macro-generated symbols in Rust/C.
- **Handling**: Classified under `dynamic_positive` in oracle evaluation. Downstream assurance marks the dynamic boundary and requires explicit runtime/LSP confirmation.

### 6.3 Dependency Injection (DI) & Magic String Routing
- **Gap**: Call connections wired at runtime via Spring, NestJS, FastAPI dependency injection containers, or string-based router declarations.
- **Handling**: Static edges are linked to the declaration/registration site; runtime resolution gaps are explicitly flagged in `ScopeReceipt.known_gaps`.

### 6.4 Cross-Repository Boundaries
- **Gap**: Calls traversing network APIs, microservices, gRPC channels, or external package binaries outside the local workspace.
- **Handling**: Bounded to the local workspace boundary. External calls are recorded as terminal external references with `UNRESOLVED_EXTERNAL` status.

## 7. Negative Claim Protocol ("Zero Callers" Rule)

To prevent accidental breakage of public interfaces, asserting **"0 callers"** or **"no affected dependents"** is strictly forbidden unless all of the following conditions are simultaneously met:

1. **Target Identity Unique**: Symbol is unambiguous and uniquely resolved across the workspace.
2. **Fresh Snapshot**: HEAD commit and working tree dirty content fingerprint are synchronized with zero uncommitted drift.
3. **Complete Scope Coverage**: 100% of candidate files within the bounded package/module are indexed and parsed without parser errors.
4. **Exhausted Pagination**: All result buffers from the underlying engine are fully consumed.
5. **No Truncation**: Output hard caps were not triggered during evidence collection.
6. **No Intersecting Dynamic Gaps**: The target symbol does not lie within a reflection or dynamic dispatch boundary.

If any single condition is unfulfilled, SOT-Graph outputs:
> *"No callers found within reported scope and active provider capabilities; completeness is unproven beyond verified AST boundaries."*
