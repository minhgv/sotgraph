"""sot_graph.assurance.impact_pipeline — canonical impact-claim flow (SG-105).

ONE pipeline from a validated request to a digest-stable post-change
receipt. CLI/MCP surfaces migrate onto this module in a later part; it
stays presentation-free (no stdout, no argparse).

Flow:

    :class:`ImpactClaimRequest`.normalize()
      → pre-change worktree snapshot, content-bound to the diff's files
        (same capture the CLI diff-impact command performs before any
        auto-reconcile mutates the index)
      → optional auto-reconcile (same ``Reconciler`` call, failure
        recorded on the receipt instead of printed)
      → :func:`sot_graph.assurance.receipts.diff_impact_receipt` with the
        captured pre-snapshot (the receipt constructs/invokes the
        diff-impact engine exactly as the receipts path always has, so
        there is exactly ONE engine per claim)
      → ``request`` + ``projection`` augmentation (SG-104 projection
        vocabulary) and digest recompute over the augmented payload

:class:`ReceiptStore` persists the content-addressed canonical form of a
receipt under ``<repo_root>/.sot/receipts/``. No retention/GC in this
phase: the store grows monotonically and cleanup policy belongs to a
later part.
