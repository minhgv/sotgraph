"""sot_graph.assurance.state - canonical assurance state machine (P0 / P1).

The ONE decision function behind every assurance surface (CLI receipts,
MCP tools, tests). No surface computes its own status vocabulary: facts
go in, the canonical status + reason codes come out. Fail-closed: any
missing or below-threshold fact downgrades the verdict - there is no
default path that upgrades toward ASSURED_WITHIN_SCOPE.

Contract 1 (plan P0/P1 trust-chain, 2026-08-28):
Gathers all active failure reasons and reduces to the highest-severity
status via the canonical severity lattice:
  ABSTAINED > UNVERIFIABLE > STALE > CONFLICTED > PARTIAL > ASSURED_WITHIN_SCOPE
