"""sot_graph.assurance.receipts — impact receipts with schema + digest (P7).

Two receipt kinds, never interchangeable:

- :func:`scope_receipt` (PRE-change): the bounded, evidenced picture of
  a target BEFORE an edit — resolved identity, snapshot binding, source
  anchors, direct callers/callees, relations, bounded transitive
  impact, affected files, candidate tests, ledger cross-check, coverage
  and gaps, risk-based assurance rules, and the OMP confirmations the
  operator still owes. Its ``proof_scope`` is ``pre_change_only``: it
  can never substitute for post-change proof.
- :func:`diff_impact_receipt` (POST-change): wraps the diff-impact
  engine result with a post-change snapshot, invalidated-evidence
  markers, reconcile outcome, remaining gaps, and an explicit closure
  decision.

Both carry ``schema_version`` and a deterministic ``digest`` (canonical
JSON → sha256) so a receipt can be stored, diffed, and re-verified.

#: SG-107 bounded-collection caps. The caps themselves are unchanged
#: bounded-work budgets; what changed is that each capped collector now
#: REPORTS its accounting (true enumerated vs returned via a twin COUNT
#: query) instead of silently returning the first N rows. Each cap has a
#: stable source id — owned by the registry in :mod:`.accounting`
#: (P1-4), so the contract tests bind to (module, collector) names and
#: stable ids instead of source line numbers — that lands in
#: ``AssuranceFacts.truncation_sources`` (and therefore in
#: ``collection_truncated:<source>`` reason codes) whenever it actually
#: cuts a collection. ``ensure_accounted`` is the production-side
#: fail-closed gate: an id outside the registry can never enter a
#: receipt.
