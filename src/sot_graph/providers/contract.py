"""sot_graph.providers.contract — versioned plugin contract (P3.4).

A federated evidence provider joins sot-graph through a VERSIONED
contract instead of orchestrator changes:

1. The adapter class declares ``contract_version`` (must equal
   :data:`PROVIDER_CONTRACT_VERSION`).
2. It implements the :class:`~sot_graph.providers.base.EvidenceProvider`
   protocol — capability-negotiated, bounded methods.
3. It passes the golden-capture contract checks
   (:func:`run_contract_checks`): schema drift fails CLOSED (never a
   lenient text parse), read paths never spawn index/install work, and
   no method raises on provider-side failure.

The entry-point loader (:func:`validate_entry_point_provider`) enforces
the same rules for adapters discovered via the ``sot_graph.providers``
entry-point group. Loading never installs anything and never issues a
query — installation is the explicit ``sotgraph providers sync`` path only.
