"""sot_graph.providers.lifecycle — provider lifecycle manifest (P9.3).

Roadmap §8.1: every evidence provider declares a lifecycle manifest —
probe, health, capability, contract/wire versions, upgrade and rollback
policy — derived live from the registry (never hand-maintained), so the
operator and CI can decide, before trusting a provider, whether it is
the version this adapter was built against and what to do when it is
not.

Read-only by construction: reuses :mod:`providers_registry` probes.
