## Probes — assurance
- ✅ `coverage-mtime-false-stale` — P1 coverage.py:229 — OK (38ms)
  - state=unknown (sha-based staleness consistent)
- ✅ `tests-to-run-none` — P1 receipts.py:563 — OK (8ms)
  - tests_to_run reads TestImpact.path; no 'test_file' reference

## Probes — core-storage
- ✅ `journal-like-wildcard` — P1 db.py:676 — OK (5ms)
  - wildcard path did not match a different journal row
- ✅ `manifest-digest-collapse` — P1 envelope.py:29 — OK (1ms)
  - fail-closed, states distinguishable: ['<raised:OperationalError>', '<raised:ProgrammingError>']

## Probes — extraction
- ✅ `nested-gitignore` — P2 ignore.py:101,184 — OK (1ms)
  - scoped rules anchored correctly and nested files loaded

## Probes — query-analytics

## Probes — sync-healing
- ✅ `polling-deferred-drop` — P1 watcher.py:154 — OK (691ms)
  - LockBusy-deferred path re-published via cross-cycle carry-over
- ✅ `watchfiles-pending-carryover` — P1 watcher.py:76 — OK (1ms)
  - pending is unioned into the next batch and fed from deferred
- ✅ `watcher-unsupported-churn` — P2 reconciler.py:508 — OK (10ms)
  - unsupported binary excluded at the gate; never journaled
- ✅ `jit-fresh-despite-failed-reconcile` — P1 verifier.py:416 — OK (13ms)
