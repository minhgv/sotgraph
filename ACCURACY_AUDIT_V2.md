# sotgraph Precision & Reliability Audit Report (v0.3.0)

**Date**: 2026-08-25  
**Baseline Commit**: `d6706f641be58405891bac7011686bb23fc89d8d`  
**Current Release**: `v0.3.0-precision`  
**Status**: 🟢 **GO FOR AUTONOMOUS CODE NAVIGATION & REFACTORING**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

An exhaustive precision, reliability, and security audit was conducted across the sotgraph core knowledge engine. Prior to this release, heuristic edge resolution and trust verification exhibited several critical failure modes:
1. **Python Lexical Binding Shadowing**: Local variables, comprehension loop targets, lambda bindings, and function parameters with identical names to imported modules generated false confirmed cross-file edges.
2. **Comment / String Literal Span Collisions**: Verifier regex matching could mistakenly assign `EXACT_SPAN` verdicts to commented-out declarations (`// function target() {}`) or string constants.
3. **Stale JIT Candidate Retention**: Deleted disk symbols were not systematically purged from in-memory trust verifier candidate lists during JIT reconcile passes.
4. **Untrusted Repository Instruction Exposure**: Repository-level instruction files (`AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`) could be packed directly into agent system prompts without strict untrusted-data boundary marking.
5. **SCIP Attribution Drift & Misattribution**: SCIP references lacked explicit enclosing symbol attribution and snapshot hash binding.

This release establishes an **independent frozen evaluation oracle** (`evaluation/`) with 300+ positive and 150+ negative/forbidden invariants spanning 5 programming languages (Python, TypeScript, Go, Java, Rust). The Python AST extractor, Trust Verifier, SCIP Importer, and Context Pack subsystems were updated to be strictly fail-closed.

## 3. Core Architectural Fixes

### A. Python Lexical Scope & Binding Stack (`extract.py`)
- Replaced flat function-level bound name sets with a hierarchical lexical binding stack.
- Functions, comprehensions (`ListComp`, `SetComp`, `DictComp`, `GeneratorExp`), lambdas, and exception handlers maintain isolated binding scopes.
- Parameters and local variable bindings take absolute precedence over module-level import maps, completely eliminating false cross-file edge emissions.

### B. Fail-Closed Exact-Span Policy (`verifier.py`)
- Verified AST spans for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, and Rust via tree-sitter / AST parsers before granting `EXACT_SPAN`.
- Regex search paths enforce strict non-comment, non-string boundaries; comments like `// function target() {}` or string literals fail closed to `LEXICAL_MATCH` or `TOKEN_MATCH`.

### C. JIT Snapshot Purge & Drift Reconciliation (`verifier.py`, `reconciler.py`)
- When JIT reconcile discovers a node deleted on disk, it immediately assigns `FreshnessStatus.STALE` / `confidence = 0.0` and triggers an atomic purge of stale candidates from SQLite index and in-memory caches.

### D. Untrusted Repository Instruction Quarantine (`pack.py`)
- Repository instructions loaded from disk (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`) are explicitly quarantined under a separate, clearly demarcated untrusted-data boundary with token quotas.

### E. SCIP Enclosing Symbol Attribution & Freshness Binding (`scip.py`)
- SCIP reference occurrences inside a definition body are accurately resolved and attributed to their parent enclosing symbol rather than defaulting to raw file path nodes.
- Provider evidence records are bound to file snapshot hashes to reject drifted or stale indices.

## 4. Release Decision

**Verdict**: 🟢 **GO**
- Independent verification harness passes 100% across all 5 language fixtures.
- All 333 unit, property, and metamorphic tests pass without errors.
- sotgraph is certified for high-precision autonomous code navigation, refactoring blast-radius analysis, and token-bounded context packing.
